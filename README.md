# Practical 8 (Week 4) - Information Architecture
You will conduct an analysis of the York Sport website in terms of its Information Architecture design. You should work in pairs or 3s, particularly for stage 2. 
## Exercise 1: Critical Analysis
Open the York Sport website (https://www.york-sport.com/).

From the home page, identify all the navigation menus for the site (there are multiple) and take note of the top-level headings and any subpages. We have cards / Post Its for you to use. Record one heading / subpage per card.

Perform a critical analysis of the information architecture design of the site. Record your comments and reflections. We will discuss as a class about 30 minutes into the session.

Refer explicitly to the IA patterns and principles discussed in the lectures (e.g. LATCH). I also recommend reading the Principles of IA by Dan Brown, which you can find on the VLE under Week 4: Reading or at this link: https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bult.2010.1720360609

## Exercise 2: Card Sort
Working in pairs or groups of 3, perform an open card sort to come up with an improved navigation structure:
1.	Group the cards into logical (to you) categories. Which cards naturally go together?
2.	Give each group a heading.

Try performing this task multiple times from different user perspectives e.g.
- Someone not affiliated with the university who has never visited a York Sport location exploring offerings with a view to potentially becoming a member or using the facilities. This user is also looking at websites for other health and sport facilities in York.
- Someone who has used a York Sport facility in the past.

You may find you can come up with multiple “natural” groupings. This is fine! 

## Exercise 3: Site Map
Based on the structure of the information you have developed through the card sort, create a site map for your new York Sport website. Remember that a site map can (and should) incorporate more than just the pages on the site, by referring to the types of information included under each section of content.
